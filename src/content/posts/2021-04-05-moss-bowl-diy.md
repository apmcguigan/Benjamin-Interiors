I’ve been seeing moss bowls at different decor stores like RH or Homesense, but thought I would try to DIY one myself to save money. \
\
This moss bowl DIY took me less than 20 minutes and was only $10 to create. 🤩 I love a simple diy, and now I have some trendy decor. If you don’t have much decor in your home, sometimes the best way to decorate is with a DIY. 💪🏻You will save money and it will make that item even more special because you made it yourself. I know I feel more accomplished and proud of an item when it is something I made rather than purchased.
