**1 on 1 consultation** 

This package is for those that have a problem area in their home, or are looking for a little help in perfecting their room(s). We will hop on a phone call or video chat for 1 hour and you can ask me any questions you have about decorating your home. I ask that photos of the rooms or spaces you would like help with be sent ahead of time via email so that during our meeting we can get right into designing. After the call I will send along a recap of our discussion so you will be able to look back on what we talked about anytime.

* one hour 1on1 call
* discuss any areas in your home 
* ask questions you have about decorating
* recap document detailing what we discussed

**eDesign Package (One Room)**

An eDesign is my all-in-one package service. We start off with a 1 hour phone consultation to discuss plans and what requirements you have to ensure all of your needs are met. I then go create a Design Board for the space you have chosen. Once I send you your design board this is the time you will be able to request any revisions. After the revisions (if needed) I will send you your design board along with notes associated with the items in the board. Think of it kind of like instructions on how to decorate the space as if I was there in person.

* 1hr consultation call to discuss plans and what needs to be done
* design board and everything that comes along with it
* detailed document explaining how to implement the design board
* one revision allowed per board
